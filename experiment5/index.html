				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Simulates the Necker Cube optical illusion as it spins around.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The Necker Cube consists of 2D vectors which constantly rotate at a slow speed. It consists of a front and back face, which spin around and occasionally change color based on a timer to change appearances behind looking like they're visibly in front & behind.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Had a lot of fun with this assignment and trying to make something entirely new. I don't think I fully nailed the optical illusion but I think I did what I could within the reasonable scope of p5.js.
