				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I wanted to make an interactive vector art piece, and noticed a lot of the examples tend to have static vector art if it's interactive. My goal was to make\n
					A vector art that is animated without the user doing anything, but still has an extra layer of interactivity.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>After circles are made in a grid with randomly assigned speed variables, the circles oscillate in size using a sin() function to emulate it growing and shrinking,\n
					as if they are animated. Then, relative to the cursor, each circle's speed of oscillation increases on a linear scale, alongside its color.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The hardest part of this was figuring out how to make the circles oscillate. It ended up being very annoying and I didn't think I'd have to be googling my trig functions\n
					to figure it out, but oh well. The second hardest part was figuring out how to make the experiment fit in the canvas (deleted all the initial code at the beginning. oops!).
