				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Rock Paper Scissors! Two players (Or one lonely player) hold out hands for rock, paper, or scissors, and click the shoot button. If it says "ERROR", that means it doesn't detect two hands on the screen. The program calculates who won once you click the shoot button based on the two hand positions.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Using machine learning, the web camera sees your hand positions and tries to figure out which hand is being held out based on the distance between your finger's start and end positions.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Figuring out how hands work was fun, albeit very tedious and took a lot of trial and error. In the end though it worked, so!
